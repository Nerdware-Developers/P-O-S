THIS IS THE CORRECT CODE - COPY THIS ENTIRE FILE TO GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT

Open GoogleAppsScript/Code.gs in your project and copy ALL of it to Google Apps Script.

Make sure line 104 says: const apiKey = request.parameter.apiKey;
It should NOT say: const apiKey = request.headers['X-API-Key']

After pasting, save and create a NEW deployment.
